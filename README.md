## About

This is an extension of [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui.git) in order to generate audio using [vits-simple-api](https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api.git).

I have only tested it in my own environment. This project is open source for sharing. Pull requests are welcome.
